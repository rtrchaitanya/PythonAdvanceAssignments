    "# 1. What are the benefits of the built-in array package, if any?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name. In arrays, the elements can be accessed randomly by using the index number. Arrays allocate memory in contiguous memory locations for all its elements. Hence there is no chance of extra memory being allocated in case of arrays. This avoids memory overflow or shortage of memory in arrays."

    "Answer: The number of elements to be stored in an array should be known in advance. An array is a static structure (which means the array is of fixed size). Once declared the size of the array cannot be modified. The memory which is allocated to it cannot be increased or decreased.\n",

The dtype of any numpy array containing string values is the maximum length of any string present in the array.Once set, it will only be able to store new string having length not more than the maximum length at the time of the creation.
