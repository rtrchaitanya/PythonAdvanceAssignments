    "# 3. Circular importing, such as when two modules import each other, can lead to dependencies and bugs that aren't visible. How can you go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Circular importing means importing the two modules in each other. If suppose we are wokring in MOD1.py file and it is importing some function say F2() from some other module say MOD2.PY file or we can do vice-versa. What will happen is: This will give an import error.\n",

In that case it will return the module in which we are working on. Suppose if that moudle is being imported from some other module then name will have the name of that moudle from where the current module has been imported. The current module in which we are working is refer to the string __main __."

    "Reverse Polish notation (also known as postfix notation) is one of multiple notations for representing mathematical expressions. Most of us are familiar with infix notation, but there are also the less popular prefix and postfix notations.\n",

    "The most obvious difference among these lie in the position of operators in the expression.\n",

    "Other differences include the significance of space as a separator (prefix and postfix are space sensitive while infix is not) and the way order of operations is expressed. The order of operation is inherent in the expression structure in prefix and postfix notations while the infix notation requires the use of parentheses to make the order of operations explicit."
